## Usage
I desgined this software in response to an unforeseen adversity in my education: the amount of spam email I receive.
College after college, course after course, update after update, I was tiring of sorting through hundreds of emails a day, so I programmed this.
It was a great learning experience in Python; specifically, I learned about TKinter front-end development, the IMAP system and file transfer, and standalone applications.
